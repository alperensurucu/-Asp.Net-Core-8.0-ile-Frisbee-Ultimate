# Asp.net Core 0.8 ile Frizbee Ultimate
# Graduate Team Sports Project

This project is created to share my experience as a team player in the university's graduate team for three years. It is an ASP.NET Core MVC project designed to showcase my sports activities and maintain my habits.

## Project Structure

The project is structured under the ASP.NET Core MVC pattern and consists of the following main components:

- **Controllers:** The project includes a controller named `CourseController`.
- **Models:** It represents my sports experience and in-game situations using the `Course` model.
- **Views:** The project has view designs under the `Views` directory, including `Content` and `Index`.

## Project Description

This project encapsulates my impressions, in-game emotional states, and sports experiences during the three years I spent with the graduate team. This information is systematically presented in views and models under the `CourseController`.

## Development Plans

While initially created to maintain personal habits, this project also has the potential for long-term development based on requests from the ultimate team. I plan to extend the content according to the needs of the team and the overall development roadmap.
